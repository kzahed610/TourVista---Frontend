/* WHY: After removing conflicting global styles from `AuthPanel.css`, the login form had no centering styles. */
/* This class creates a dedicated container for the login page that uses flexbox to perfectly center the */
/* `AuthPanel` component both vertically and horizontally. Using `100vh` (viewport height) ensures it fills the whole screen. */
